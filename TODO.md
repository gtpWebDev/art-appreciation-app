# TO-Do List

## Data

- Consider adding "purchase loop" purchase date for all transactions - the most recent purchase date for example related to a listing - this will provide the ability to analyse by month in relation to eh most recent purchase. Limited currently to mint month/year which will be interesting at the top level, but less so by accout.

## Formatting

- Change drawer to open above the page, rather than pushing it to the right.
- Centre all content in container, with maximum xl width.
- Add minimum width of ocerall site?

## Error handling

- Full review of error logic (coordinated with backend) to cover network errors, failed server responses, in-app errors.
